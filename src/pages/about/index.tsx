          PPEForFree is a sense-making movement by the people and for the people. We
          combine Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Data Science capabilities with the
          ethos and community of Wikipedia to help light a path for the millions of
          restless minds searching for the means to fight the PPE shortage.

        <Paragraph>
          Today we live in an age defined by an unprecedented amount of digital
          information. Sadly, our information ecology, the internet, is polluted with
          misinformation, low quality data, fake news, spam and a whole suite of other
          related issues.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Not only that, but we have a fragmented community spread out over thousands of
          messaging boards, facebook groups, private messaging channels and so forth. Some
          important innovation that happens in one corner of the web doesnâ€™t necessarily
          reach everywhere else. So we have thousands of people reinventing the wheel.
        </Paragraph>
        <Title level={2}>Strategy</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          Our first goal is to dramatically scale and boost the efficiency of the
          decentralized Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply chains that have sprung
          up. Right now, there are regular people all over the world making PPE in their
          community through what we call the Grassroots PPE Supply Chain. We want to turn
          it up all the way to 11. We are going to amplify the signal, reduce the noise by
          attempting to fix the information ecology of the PPE supply chain using a fresh
          new approach.
