      <h1>PPEForFree</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        PPEForFree is a sense-making movement by the people and for the people.
        We combine Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Data Science
        capabilities with the ethos and community of Wikipedia to help light a
        path for the millions of restless minds searching for the means to fight
        the PPE shortage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today we live in an age defined by an unprecedented amount of digital
        information. Sadly, our information ecology, the internet, is polluted
        with misinformation, low quality data, fake news, spam and a whole suite
        of other related issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only that, but we have a fragmented community spread out over
        thousands of messaging boards, facebook groups, private messaging
        channels and so forth. Some important innovation that happens in one
        corner of the web doesnâ€™t necessarily reach everywhere else. So we have
        thousands of people reinventing the wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first goal is to dramatically scale and boost the efficiency of the
        decentralized Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply chains that
        have sprung up. Right now, there are regular people all over the world
        making PPE in their community through what we call the Grassroots PPE
        Supply Chain. We want to turn it up all the way to 11. We are going to
        amplify the signal, reduce the noise by attempting to fix the
        information ecology of the PPE supply chain using a fresh new approach.
        How are we going to do this?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          grab the public data from PPE Facebook groups automatically and
          display that data in a table.
        </li>
        <li>
          make the site as user friendly and useful as possible with insightful
          visualisations of data and search / filter / sort / export
          functionality for easy discovery.
        </li>
        <li>
          crowd-source discovery of new groups by allowing users to submit links
          on the website.
        </li>
        <li>
          build a team of outreach volunteers to manually verify each
          crowd-sourced submission, as well as to reach out to the groups and
          open lines of communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          provide an open API and a kickass open-source community so potential
          competitors work with us instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          convince as many leaders as possible to include a link to this website
          somewhere where it is visible to every single person in their
          organisation.
        </li>
        <li>
          aggregate all the information, particularly links, shared acoss all
          facebook groups, vetted by subject matter expert volunteers, and
          display them here.
        </li>
        <li>share this website agressively on social media</li>
        <li>make this site accessible in as many languages as possible</li>
        <li>
          create a comprehensive gold standard repository of PPE designs,
          methodologies, processes, tools, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          provide a legal framework with free waivers for every juristiction to
          allow those donating homemade PPE to do so knowing they are staying
          within the law.
        </li>
      </ul>
