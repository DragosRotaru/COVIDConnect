      <p>
        In the age of information warfare, fake news and a polluted information
        ecology, our capacity to engage in mutually beneficial decision-making
        begins and ends with our ability to find capital-T universal Truth in
        the sea of noise. The collective struggle to make sense of what is and
        is not True leads us to fundamental disagreements about the nature of
        reality - a fragmentation of our understanding of what is, what was and
        what ought to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Truth is not a matter of opinion; it is a common good, as much yours
          as it is mine. Truth is impartial and apolitical. Truth is the fuel
          that feeds the fires of Justice.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Every good decision is conceived by the seed of Truth. It sprouts when a
        person acknowledges the Truth and it blooms when that person makes the
        conscious choice to act on it. Our inability to make good decisions
        perpetuates human suffering. This is particularly evident in moments of
        crisis, when the stakes are higher, the senses are hightened and the
        pretense of normalcy is stripped away to expose the failings of a broken
        system laid bare.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mission of this project is to grow a sense-making movement for the
        people and by the people. A movement that combines the OSINT (Open
        Source Intelligence) capabilities of the NSA, the ethos or community of
        Wikipedia, the freedom of the internet and the determination of millions
        of restless minds searching for the means to create a better tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution is not simple or singular, It cannot be boiled down without
        doing you a disservice and a detailed explanation is both beyond the
        scope of this document and a lame way to convince you. Instead we will
        demonstrate by example. Words are cheap. Many people have a lot of
        things to say about world affairs but few take action. Furthermore, this
        is all about thinking globally and acting locally. We are not
        architecting a way to restructure civilization or anything crazy like
        that. We are, at the core, tool makers and truth seekers looking to make
        a dent and move the needle of progress.

        So what is this? At minimum it is an attempt to fix the information
        ecology of the PPE supply chain using a fresh new approach. Hence why
        this site is called PPEForFree.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ok enough talk... So where do we start?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well right now there are regular people all over the world making PPE in
        their community through what we call the Grassroots PPE Supply Chain. We
        want to turn it up all the way to 11. We are going to amplify the
        signal, reduce the noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Step 1: make this site the central hub for Grassroots PPE Supply Chain
          information.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          grab the public data from PPE Facebook groups automatically and
          display that data in a table.
        </li>
        <li>
          make the site as user friendly and useful as possible with insightful
          visualisations of data and search / filter / sort / export
          functionality for easy discovery.
        </li>
        <li>
          crowd-source discovery of new groups by allowing users to submit links
          on the website.
        </li>
        <li>
          build a team of outreach volunteers to manually verify each
          crowd-sourced submission, as well as to reach out to the groups and
          open lines of communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          provide an open API and a kickass open-source community so potential
          competitors work with us instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          convince as many leaders as possible to include a link to this website
          somewhere where it is visible to every single person in their
          organisation.
        </li>
        <li>
          aggregate all the information, particularly links, shared acoss all
          facebook groups, vetted by subject matter expert volunteers, and
          display them here.
        </li>
        <li>share this website agressively on social media</li>
        <li>make this site accessible in as many languages as possible</li>
        <li>
          create a comprehensive gold standard repository of PPE designs,
          methodologies, processes, tools, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          provide a legal framework with free waivers for every juristiction to
          allow those donating homemade PPE to do so knowing they are staying
          within the law.
        </li>
