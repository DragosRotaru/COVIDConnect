      <p>
        In the age of information warfare, fake news and a polluted information
        ecology, our capacity to engage in mutually beneficial decision-making
        begins and ends with our ability to uncover Truth in the sea of noise.
        The collective struggle to make sense of what is True and what is not
        leads us to fundamental disagreements about the nature of reality - a
        fragmentation of our understanding of what is and what ought to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truth is not a matter of opinion; it is a common good, as much yours as
        it is mine. Truth is impartial and apolitical. Truth is the fuel that
        feeds the fires of Justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every good decision is conceived by the seed of Truth. It sprouts when a
        person acknowledges the Truth and it blooms when a person makes the
        conscious choice to act on it. Our inability to make good decisions
        perpetuates Human suffering. This is particularly evident in moments of
        crisis, when the stakes are higher, the senses are hightened and the
        pretense of normalcy is stripped away to expose the consequences of a
        broken system laid bare. The Truth is, this pandemic doesn't care if you
        did everything right. Our local actions have global consequences. We
        need everyone, everywhere at every level of society to make better
        decisions.
      </p>
      <p>Finding the Truth starts with quality information.</p>
      <p>
        The mission of this project is to grow a sense-making machine for the
        people and by the people. A machine that combines the OSINT (Open Source
        Intelligence) capabilities of the NSA, the ethos or community of
        Wikipedia, the freedom of the internet and the determination of millions
        of restless minds searching for the means to create a better tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This machine will be used to break down information silos. It will be
        used to provide tools that empower the individual. It will be used to
        unify fragmented groups. It will be used to find truthful, accurate and
        relevant data, and put it in the hands of those that wield the power to
        use it for good. It will be used to amplify the signal and reduce the
        noise. If this sounds vague, keep reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a viable DIY PPE ecosystem to exist, we need coordination and
        cooperation. People need to fall in line with already existing efforts.
        The mission of this project is to enhance the sense-making and
        coordination machinery of the DIY PPE ecosystem. Right now people are
        acting locally, which is awesome, but we need them to also think
        globally.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do this by decluttering the web of redundant efforts. We actively
        maintain single (open) sources of truth â€“ a comprehensive directory of
        local initiatives. A repository of gold standard designs. Working Groups
        to solve problems. We create a funnel for people to find their tribe. We
        standardize. We integrate. We unify. We increase the signal, reduce the
        noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first goal is to dramatically scale and boost the efficiency of the
        grassroots decentralized Personal Protective Equipment supply chain that
        has sprung up before our eyes. If you are not familiar, millions of
        people and small businesses around the world are producing face masks,
        face shields, ventilators and a whole range of supplies for their local
        hospitals and other front line organizations.
