        For a viable DIY PPE ecosystem to exist, we need coordination and
        cooperation. People need to fall in line with already existing efforts.
        The mission of this project is to enhance the sense-making and
        coordination machinery of the DIY PPE ecosystem. Right now people are
        acting locally, which is awesome, but we need them to also think
        globally.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do this by decluttering the web of redundant efforts. We actively
        maintain single (open) sources of truth â€“ a comprehensive directory of
        local initiatives. A repository of gold standard designs. Working Groups
        to solve problems. We create a funnel for people to find their tribe. We
        standardize. We integrate. We unify. We increase the signal, reduce the
        noise.
